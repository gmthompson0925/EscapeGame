# Escape Game

This is my version of the Building Escape Project I worked on in an Unreal Udemy Course. It was mainly focused on level design but I tried being creative with the objective. I used the Medieval Dungeon Asset Package from the Epic Games Store to design my level. Aside from a collision hickup, I thought it turned out pretty smoothly! Try it out!
